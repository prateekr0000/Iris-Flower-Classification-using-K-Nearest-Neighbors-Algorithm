# Iris-Flower-Classification-using-K-Nearest-Neighbors-Algorithm
This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset used in this project is the Iris Dataset, which includes 150 samples of Iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.


# The project involves the following steps:
Data collection and preparation
Data exploration and visualization
Training and testing data division
Feature scaling
Model building using KNN algorithm
Model evaluation using accuracy score and confusion matrix

This project is implemented using Python and popular libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
